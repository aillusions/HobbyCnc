  G-code is a simple language and creating your own code is just a matter of logical thinking and some basic math.</p>
                          <p>The
picture at the left shows how to mill a large hole using a small mill.
Remember, the mill rotates in a clockwise direction so if we are
cutting a hole out of a sheet or a block, we need to make sure we mill
in the right direction - which is also clockwise.<br>
  Moving counterclockwise would be pulling the cutter out of the work piece and results in a bad result.</p></td>

                    <p>Now let's get going with some G-code. Milling a circle or an arc needs three sets of coordinates:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>a starting point</li>
                      <li>a centre point</li>
                      <li>the end point</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The
mill now moves from point 1 to 3 around the centre point 3. If the
start and end-point are the same a complete circle is made.<br> A
circle always has to be located in a specific plane being either the
XY, YZ or XZ plane and since I mostly just create 2.5D objects I am
always milling circles in the XY plane.</p>
                    <p>To mill a hole (or actually only the contour of the hole, we need to take a number of steps:</p>

                          <li>move the mill up, away from the workpiece </li>
                        </ol></td>

                    </tbody></table>
                    <p>So
to mill a circle with a radius of 4 and the centre at x,y = 10,10 at a
depth of -1 we have to move to a starting point at the arc first, I
take the given point in the picture above as starting point, this is as
the same Y coordinate as the centre and the X coordinate is at x -
radius (in this case 10-4 = 6). A move is always done in a straight
line so only after arriving at the starting point we move down to -1.
This is done using the following G-code:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <pre>G0 x 6 y 10
G1 z -1</pre>
                    </blockquote>                    <p>A
G0 (this is a zero, not the letter O) will move at high speed to the
starting point and G1 will move the mill down at the feedrate (set with
the F... command), for now I assume that the F speed is already set. </p>
                    <p>Now we are ready to move in a circle. We have to specify the XY plane (using <strong>G17</strong>) before starting to mill a clockwise circle (using <strong>G2</strong>).
The centre location is specified relative from the starting point so
for the center X equals to 4 (the radius) and Y 0. To mill a whole
circle, we have to end at the same coordinates as we started from (so
6, 10): </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <pre>G17 G2 x 6 y 10 i 4 j 0 z -1</pre>
                    </blockquote>                    <p>As you can see there are two sets of coordinates specified in the line above: <strong>x, y</strong> specifies the end point and <strong>i, j</strong> the centre. I always specify the <strong>z</strong>
coordinate also telling to stay at the same depth. Moving to a
different Z-value would mill a helix (i.e. the mill would move up or
down along the arc).</p>
                    <p>And clear away from the workpiece:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <pre>G0 z 1</pre>
                    </blockquote>                    <p>So that's it, we are done - right?</p>
                    <p>No,
all we did is move a full circle and if I had a 3mm flat tip cutter
this will result in a hole that is too large. The centre of the cutter
moves along the circle so we have removed too much material (on all
sides the radius of the cutter) so we have to compensate for the cutter
radius:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>We have to start 1.5 mm further to the right from the starting point so we start at x = 6 + 1.5</li>
                      <li>The centre has to stay at the same location so the relative coordinate for the centre x is now 4 - 1.5 </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This results in the following piece of code:</p>
                    <blockquote><pre>G0 x 7.5 y 10
G1 z -1
G17 G2 x 7.5 y 10 i 2.5 j 0 z -1
G0 z 1 </pre></blockquote>
                    <p>And
now we are done! We have a contour that might leave a hole of the given
size at the wanted location. If we need a hole with a large radius we
need to repeat the movement starting with smaller circles and moving to
larger ones until the wanted diameter is reached. Same goes for the
depth, we can not remove too much material at once depending on the
material, cutter type, spindle speed and feedrate. </p>          </td>

		    <p><big>Using variables </big>
		    </p><p>
The example above is nice, but I do not want to calculate all this
every time by hand. Variables in G-code are denoted by a <strong>#</strong> followed by a number. I could give a whole explanation of how to do this, but let's just show the code:
		    </p><blockquote>
		      <pre>#1 = 10        ( X of centre of circle )
#2 = 10        ( Y of centre )
#3 = 8         ( Diameter of circle )
#4 = 3         ( Cutter diameter )
#5 = -1        ( Z	depth )
#6 = [#3 - #4] ( Diameter of circle to mill
#6 = [#6 / 2]  ( Radius of circle to mill )

G0 z 2
G0 x [#1 - #6] y #2&gt;
G1 z #5&gt;
G17 G2 x [#1 - #6] y #2 i #6 j 0 z #5
G1 z 2</pre>
	        </blockquote>		    		    <p>First
there are the five parameters to mill a hole at coordinates 10,10 at a
depth of -1 with a radius of 4 (diameter = 8) and a 3mm cutter.<br>
Then the milling circle is calculated, calculations on parameters
always have to be within square brackets. The radius for that is
(8-3)/2 = 2.5.</p>
          <p>As you will notice I added an extra <strong>G0 z 2</strong>
at the beginning of the milling path, this is just to make sure that
the movement towards the starting point is always done above the work
piece. Otherwise there is a chance that we come across some pieces that
are in between our current position and the starting point. <br>
            And the text in between brackets are just comments, these will be ignored by our milling centre. </p></td>

		    <p><big>Subroutines, using the same lines of G-code more than once </big>
            </p><p>Ok,
that worked. But now we want to create multiple circles without having
to copy and paste all those lines of code through the whole file.<br> A
subroutine is a piece of code that is only executed if we call that
specific subroutine later on in the file. Subroutines (and looping
constructs and decisions) are all marked with labels at the beginning
and end of the section and the subroutine always starts with a label
followed by <strong>sub</strong> and ends with a label with <strong>endsub</strong>.<br>
All I know is that labels have numbers, maybe it is possible to use
names but I have not seen the documentation to confirm this. </p><p>Parameters given to this subroutine when being called are also numbered, starting at <strong>#1</strong> and ranging up to the number of parameters we specify in the call:
			</p><blockquote>
		      <pre>( Mill a hole with the centre at x,y and diameter d, diameter of mill Md and depth z )
( Parameters:  x  y  d Md  z )
(             #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 )
O100 sub
    #6 = [#3 - #4] ( Diameter of circle to mill )
    #6 = [#6 / 2]  ( Radius of circle to mill )

    G0 z 2
    G0 x [#1 - #6] y #2
    G1 z #5&gt;
    G17 G2 x [#1 - #6] y #2 i #6 j 0 z #5
    G1 z 2
O100 endsub
</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And now we can call this subroutine as
often as we like. So now we are done, milling our hole with a diameter
of 8 mm can finally be completed.<br> Remember how we started with just
milling the outer circle, leaving a bit in the middle because of the
3mm mill used? (I'll add some photos this weekend) By milling multiple
circles with a diameter increase of no more than the diameter of the
mill, we can mill the complete hole easily: </p><blockquote>
			  <pre>O100 call [10] [10] [5] [3] [-1]
O100 call [10] [10] [8] [3] [-1]</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The
first circle should always be smaller than twice the mill diameter,
otherwise some material is left in the middle of the hole and on my
machine I don't like to remove too much material at once so when
milling edges (and the second circle is just a round edge) I never
remove more than half the mill diameter in one go, so the circles are
at max. the mill diameter apart.<br> This also depends of the material
used, in foam I can cut away way more material (I did 2.5mm edges at
4mm deep) in one go but in Aluminium I am easing up a lot, mostly
because I am still learning what the machine can handle and I don't
have a decent cooling/lubricating system yet (I use a brush and do
manual lubrication using oil) </p>

		    <p><big>The other way around: creating a round outer surface</big>
            </p><p>Is
easy to do. Just add the diameter of the mill to the diameter of the
circle to mill and use a counterclockwise move using the <strong>G3</strong> command instead of the <strong>G2</strong>.<br>
I think you should be able to do that yourself by now. </p></td>
